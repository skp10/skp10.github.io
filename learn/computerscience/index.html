				<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p><strong><em>Computer science</em></strong> is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications. 
					It is the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the 
					methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, 
					storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of 
					computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist 
					specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.</p>
					
					<p>Its fields can be divided into a variety of theoretical and practical disciplines. 
					Some fields, such as computational complexity theory (which explores the fundamental properties 
					of computational and intractable problems), are highly abstract, while fields such as computer 
					graphics emphasize real-world visual applications. Still other fields focus on challenges in 
					implementing computation. For example, programming language theory considers various approaches 
					to the description of computation, while the study of computer programming itself investigates 
					various aspects of the use of programming language and complex systems. Humanâ€“computer interaction 
					considers the challenges in making computers and computations useful, usable, and universally 
					accessible to humans.</p>

				<h2 id="history">History</h2>
					<p>The earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the 
					modern digital computer. Machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the abacus have 
					existed since antiquity, aiding in computations such as multiplication and division. Further, algorithms 
					for performing computations have existed since antiquity, even before the development of sophisticated 
					computing equipment. The ancient Sanskrit treatise Shulba Sutras, or "Rules of the Chord", is a book of 
					algorithms written in 800 BC for constructing geometric objects like altars using a peg and chord, an 
					early precursor of the modern field of computational geometry.</p>
					
					<p>Blaise Pascal designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator, Pascal's calculator, 
					in 1642.[2] In 1673, Gottfried Leibniz demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator, called the Stepped 
					Reckoner.[3] He may be considered the first computer scientist and information theorist, for, among 
					other reasons, documenting the binary number system. In 1820, Thomas de Colmar launched the mechanical 
					calculator industry[note 1] when he released his simplified arithmometer, which was the first calculating 
					machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. Charles Babbage 
					started the design of the first automatic mechanical calculator, his Difference Engine, in 1822, which 
					eventually gave him the idea of the first programmable mechanical calculator, his Analytical Engine.[4] 
					He started developing this machine in 1834 and "in less than two years he had sketched out many of the 
					salient features of the modern computer".[5] "A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system 
					from the Jacquard loom"[5] making it infinitely programmable.</p>
