				<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p><strong><em>Mechatronics</em></strong> is a multidisciplinary field of engineering that 
					includes a combination of systems engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, 
					telecommunications engineering, control engineering and computer engineering.[1][2] As 
					technology advances, the subfields of engineering multiply and adapt. Mechatronics' aim is 
					a design process that unifies these subfields. Originally, mechatronics just included the 
					combination of mechanics and electronics, hence the word is a combination of mechanics and 
					electronics; however, as technical systems have become more and more complex the word has 
					been broadened to include more technical areas.</p>
					
					<p>The word "mechatronics" originated in Japanese-English and was created by Tetsuro Mori, 
					an engineer of Yaskawa Electric Corporation. The word "mechatronics" was registered as trademark 
					by the company in Japan with the registration number of "46-32714" in 1971. However, afterward 
					the company released the right of using the word to public, and the word "mechatronics" spread 
					to the rest of the world. Nowadays, the word is translated in each language and the word is 
					considered as an essential term for industry.</p>
					
					<p>French standard NF E 01-010 gives the following definition: â€œapproach aiming at the synergistic 
					integration of mechanics, electronics, control theory, and computer science within product design 
					and manufacturing, in order to improve and/or optimize its functionality".</p>
					
					<p>Many people treat "mechatronics" as a modern buzzword synonymous with "electromechanical engineering".[3][4]</p>

				<p>A mechatronics engineer unites the principles of mechanics, electronics, and computing to 
				generate a simpler, more economical and reliable system. The term "mechatronics" was coined 
				by Tetsuro Mori, the senior engineer of the Japanese company Yaskawa in 1969. An industrial 
				robot is a prime example of a mechatronics system; it includes aspects of electronics, mechanics, 
				and computing to do its day-to-day jobs.</p>
				
				<p>Engineering cybernetics deals with the question of control engineering of mechatronic systems. 
				It is used to control or regulate such a system (see control theory). Through collaboration, 
				the mechatronic modules perform the production goals and inherit flexible and agile manufacturing 
				properties in the production scheme. Modern production equipment consists of mechatronic modules 
				that are integrated according to a control architecture. The most known architectures involve hierarchy, 
				polyarchy, heterarchy, and hybrid. The methods for achieving a technical effect are described by control 
				algorithms, which might or might not utilize formal methods in their design. Hybrid systems important to 
				mechatronics include production systems, synergy drives, planetary exploration rovers, automotive subsystems 
				such as anti-lock braking systems and spin-assist, and everyday equipment such as autofocus cameras, 
				video, hard disks, and CD players.</p>
				
				<p>Blaise Pascal designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator, Pascal's calculator, 
				in 1642.[2] In 1673, Gottfried Leibniz demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator, called the Stepped 
				Reckoner.[3] He may be considered the first computer scientist and information theorist, for, among 
				other reasons, documenting the binary number system. In 1820, Thomas de Colmar launched the mechanical 
				calculator industry[note 1] when he released his simplified arithmometer, which was the first calculating 
				machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. Charles Babbage 
				started the design of the first automatic mechanical calculator, his Difference Engine, in 1822, which 
				eventually gave him the idea of the first programmable mechanical calculator, his Analytical Engine.[4] 
				He started developing this machine in 1834 and "in less than two years he had sketched out many of the 
				salient features of the modern computer".[5] "A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system 
				from the Jacquard loom"[5] making it infinitely programmable.[note 2] In 1843, during the translation of 
				a French article on the Analytical Engine, Ada Lovelace wrote, in one of the many notes she included, 
				an algorithm to compute the Bernoulli numbers, which is considered to be the first computer program.[6] 
				Around 1885, Herman Hollerith invented the tabulator, which used punched cards to process statistical 
				information; eventually his company became part of IBM. In 1937, one hundred years after Babbage's 
				impossible dream, Howard Aiken convinced IBM, which was making all kinds of punched card equipment 
				and was also in the calculator business[7] to develop his giant programmable calculator, the ASCC/Harvard 
				Mark I, based on Babbage's Analytical Engine, which itself used cards and a central computing unit. When 
				the machine was finished, some hailed it as "Babbage's dream come true".[8]</p>
