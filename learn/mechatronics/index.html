	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p><strong><em>Mechatronics</em></strong> is a multidisciplinary field of engineering that 
		includes a combination of systems engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, 
		telecommunications engineering, control engineering and computer engineering.[1][2] As 
		technology advances, the subfields of engineering multiply and adapt. Mechatronics' aim is 
		a design process that unifies these subfields. Originally, mechatronics just included the 
		combination of mechanics and electronics, hence the word is a combination of mechanics and 
		electronics; however, as technical systems have become more and more complex the word has 
		been broadened to include more technical areas.</p>
		
		<p>The word "mechatronics" originated in Japanese-English and was created by Tetsuro Mori, 
		an engineer of Yaskawa Electric Corporation. The word "mechatronics" was registered as trademark 
		by the company in Japan with the registration number of "46-32714" in 1971. However, afterward 
		the company released the right of using the word to public, and the word "mechatronics" spread 
		to the rest of the world. Nowadays, the word is translated in each language and the word is 
		considered as an essential term for industry.</p>
		
		<p>French standard NF E 01-010 gives the following definition: “approach aiming at the synergistic 
		integration of mechanics, electronics, control theory, and computer science within product design 
		and manufacturing, in order to improve and/or optimize its functionality".</p>
		
		<p>Many people treat "mechatronics" as a modern buzzword synonymous with "electromechanical engineering".[3][4]</p>
		
		
	<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
		<p>A mechatronics engineer unites the principles of mechanics, electronics, and computing to 
		generate a simpler, more economical and reliable system. The term "mechatronics" was coined 
		by Tetsuro Mori, the senior engineer of the Japanese company Yaskawa in 1969. An industrial 
		robot is a prime example of a mechatronics system; it includes aspects of electronics, mechanics, 
		and computing to do its day-to-day jobs.</p>
		
		<p>Engineering cybernetics deals with the question of control engineering of mechatronic systems. 
		It is used to control or regulate such a system (see control theory). Through collaboration, 
		the mechatronic modules perform the production goals and inherit flexible and agile manufacturing 
		properties in the production scheme. Modern production equipment consists of mechatronic modules 
		that are integrated according to a control architecture. The most known architectures involve hierarchy, 
		polyarchy, heterarchy, and hybrid. The methods for achieving a technical effect are described by control 
		algorithms, which might or might not utilize formal methods in their design. Hybrid systems important to 
		mechatronics include production systems, synergy drives, planetary exploration rovers, automotive subsystems 
		such as anti-lock braking systems and spin-assist, and everyday equipment such as autofocus cameras, 
		video, hard disks, and CD players.</p>
		
		<p>Blaise Pascal designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator, Pascal's calculator, 
		in 1642.[2] In 1673, Gottfried Leibniz demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator, called the Stepped 
		Reckoner.[3] He may be considered the first computer scientist and information theorist, for, among 
		other reasons, documenting the binary number system. In 1820, Thomas de Colmar launched the mechanical 
		calculator industry[note 1] when he released his simplified arithmometer, which was the first calculating 
		machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. Charles Babbage 
		started the design of the first automatic mechanical calculator, his Difference Engine, in 1822, which 
		eventually gave him the idea of the first programmable mechanical calculator, his Analytical Engine.[4] 
		He started developing this machine in 1834 and "in less than two years he had sketched out many of the 
		salient features of the modern computer".[5] "A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system 
		from the Jacquard loom"[5] making it infinitely programmable.[note 2] In 1843, during the translation of 
		a French article on the Analytical Engine, Ada Lovelace wrote, in one of the many notes she included, 
		an algorithm to compute the Bernoulli numbers, which is considered to be the first computer program.[6] 
		Around 1885, Herman Hollerith invented the tabulator, which used punched cards to process statistical 
		information; eventually his company became part of IBM. In 1937, one hundred years after Babbage's 
		impossible dream, Howard Aiken convinced IBM, which was making all kinds of punched card equipment 
		and was also in the calculator business[7] to develop his giant programmable calculator, the ASCC/Harvard 
		Mark I, based on Babbage's Analytical Engine, which itself used cards and a central computing unit. When 
		the machine was finished, some hailed it as "Babbage's dream come true".[8]</p>
		
		<p>During the 1940s, as new and more powerful computing machines were developed, the term computer came 
		to refer to the machines rather than their human predecessors.[9] As it became clear that computers 
		could be used for more than just mathematical calculations, the field of computer science broadened to 
		study computation in general. Computer science began to be established as a distinct academic discipline 
		in the 1950s and early 1960s.[10][11] The world's first computer science degree program, the Cambridge 
		Diploma in Computer Science, began at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory in 1953. The first 
		computer science degree program in the United States was formed at Purdue University in 1962.[12] Since 
		practical computers became available, many applications of computing have become distinct areas of study 
		in their own rights.</p>
		
		<p>Although many initially believed it was impossible that computers themselves could actually be a 
		scientific field of study, in the late fifties it gradually became accepted among the greater academic 
		population.[13][14] It is the now well-known IBM brand that formed part of the computer science revolution 
		during this time. IBM (short for International Business Machines) released the IBM 704[15] and later the 
		IBM 709[16] computers, which were widely used during the exploration period of such devices. "Still, working 
		with the IBM [computer] was frustrating […] if you had misplaced as much as one letter in one instruction, 
		the program would crash, and you would have to start the whole process over again".[13] During the late 1950s, 
		the computer science discipline was very much in its developmental stages, and such issues were commonplace.[14]</p>
		
		<p>Time has seen significant improvements in the usability and effectiveness of computing technology.[17] 
		Modern society has seen a significant shift in the users of computer technology, from usage only by experts 
		and professionals, to a near-ubiquitous user base. Initially, computers were quite costly, and some degree of 
		human aid was needed for efficient use—in part from professional computer operators. As computer adoption became 
		more widespread and affordable, less human assistance was needed for common usage.</p>
