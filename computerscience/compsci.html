	<strong>computer science</strong> that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of 
	robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.</p>
	
	<p>These technologies deal with automated machines robots for short that can take the place of humans 
	in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behaviour, and or cognition. 
	Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field
