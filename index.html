		<h2> Introduction </h2>		
		
			<p> <strong><em>Robotics</em></strong> is the branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and 
			<a href="/learn/computerscience"><strong>Computer Science</strong></a> that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of 
			robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.</p>
			
			<p>These technologies deal with automated machines robots for short that can take the place of humans 
			in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behaviour, and or cognition. 
			Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field 
			of bio-inspired robotics.</p>
			
			<p>The concept of creating machines that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times, but research into the functionality and 
			potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century. Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed that 
			robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, 
			as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes, whether domestically, 
			commercially, or militarily. Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people such as defusing bombs, finding survivors in unstable 
			ruins, and exploring mines and shipwrecks. Robotics is also used in STEM STEM is a school program that teaches kids to program and make Robots.</p>
			
			
		<h2 id="control">Control</h2>		
			<p>The mechanical structure of a robot must be controlled to perform tasks. The control of a robot involves three distinct phases – perception, 
			processing, and action (robotic paradigms). Sensors give information about the environment or the robot itself (e.g. the position of its joints 
			or its end effector). This information is then processed to be stored or transmitted, and to calculate the appropriate signals to the actuators 
			(motors) which move the mechanical.</p>
			
			<p>The processing phase can range in complexity. At a reactive level, it may translate raw sensor information directly into actuator commands. 
			Sensor fusion may first be used to estimate parameters of interest (e.g. the position of the robot's gripper) from noisy sensor data. 
			An immediate task (such as moving the gripper in a certain direction) is inferred from these estimates. Techniques from control theory convert 
			the task into commands that drive the actuators.</p>
			
			<p>At longer time scales or with more sophisticated tasks, the robot may need to build and reason with a "cognitive" model. Cognitive models 
			try to represent the robot, the world, and how they interact. Pattern recognition and computer vision can be used to track objects. Mapping 
			techniques can be used to build maps of the world. Finally, motion planning and other artificial intelligence techniques may be used to figure 
			out how to act. For example, a planner may figure out how to achieve a task without hitting obstacles, falling over, etc.</p>
			
			
			<h3>Autonomy levels</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Direct interaction is used for haptic or tele-operated devices, and the human has nearly complete control over the robot's motion.</li>
					
					<li>Operator-assist modes have the operator commanding medium-to-high-level tasks, with the robot automatically figuring out how to achieve them.</li>
					
					<li>An autonomous robot may go for extended periods of time without human interaction. Higher levels of autonomy do not necessarily require more complex 
					cognitive capabilities. For example, robots in assembly plants are completely autonomous, but operate in a fixed pattern.</li>
				</ol>

			<h3>Occupational safety and health implications of robotics</h3>
				
				<p>A discussion paper drawn up by EU-OSHA highlights how the spread of robotics presents both opportunities and challenges for occupational safety and health (OSH).[123]</p>
				
				<p>The greatest OSH benefits stemming from the wider use of robotics should be substitution for people working in unhealthy or dangerous environments. 
				In space, defence, security, or the nuclear industry, but also in logistics, maintenance and inspection, autonomous robots are particularly useful in 
				replacing human workers performing dirty, dull or unsafe tasks, thus avoiding workers’ exposures to hazardous agents and conditions and reducing physical, 
				ergonomic and psychosocial risks. For example, robots are already used to perform repetitive and monotonous tasks, to handle radioactive material or to work 
				in explosive atmospheres. In the future, many other highly repetitive, risky or unpleasant tasks will be performed by robots in a variety of sectors like 
				agriculture, construction, transport, healthcare, firefighting or cleaning services.</p>
				
				<p>Despite these advances, there are certain skills to which humans will be better suited than machines for some time to come and the question is how to 
				achieve the best combination of human and robot skills. The advantages of robotics include heavy-duty jobs with precision and repeatability, whereas 
				the advantages of humans include creativity, decision-making, flexibility and adaptability. This need to combine optimal skills has resulted in 
				collaborative robots and humans sharing a common workspace more closely and led to the development of new approaches and standards to guarantee the 
				safety of the “man-robot merger”. Some European countries are including robotics in their national programmes and trying to promote a safe and flexible 
				co-operation between robots and operators to achieve better productivity. For example, the German Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 
				(BAuA) organises annual workshops on the topic “human-robot collaboration”.</p>
				
				<p>In future, co-operation between robots and humans will be diversified, with robots increasing their autonomy and human-robot collaboration reaching 
				completely new forms. Current approaches and technical standards aiming to protect employees from the risk of working with collaborative robots will 
				have to be revised.</p>
