				<h2> Introduction </h2>		
			
					<p> <strong><em>Robotics</em></strong> is the branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and 
					<a id="compsci" href="/learn/computerscience"><strong>Computer Science</strong></a> that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of 
					robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.</p>
					
					<p>These technologies deal with automated machines robots for short that can take the place of humans 
					in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behaviour, and or cognition. 
					Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field 
					of bio-inspired robotics.</p>
					
					<p>The concept of creating machines that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times, but research into the functionality and 
					potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century. Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed that 
					robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, 
					as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes, whether domestically, 
					commercially, or militarily. Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people such as defusing bombs, finding survivors in unstable 
					ruins, and exploring mines and shipwrecks. Robotics is also used in STEM STEM is a school program that teaches kids to program and make Robots.</p>
